multi_discrete.py:
- [FIXED] Changed random_array assignment in sample() to use gym.utils.seeding

rendering.py:
- The reraise function appears to no longer exist. Fortunately, all this does is add additional information to a raised
  exception, so should be simple to reimplement (or ignore)

environment.py:
- line 234: `geom.set_color(*entity.color, alpha=0.5)` - receives multiple arguments. This is a pain, because it is
  expanding the color argument, a 3-tuple or 4-tuple, but we want to set alpha to 0.5. A dumb fix is to make a new
  tuple with the first three arguments of the color, and 0.5 for alpha.

simple_crypto.py:
- line 121: array in conditional can potentially be a boolean rather than an ndarray so it will have no .all() method
- line 122: the sizes in the expression `agent.state.c - agent.goal_a.color` are mismatched and it is unclear where they
  come from
