## This folders incude some agents for gym's mountain car environment.
## The codes in this folder are using Python 3.6.1, gym==0.13.1,numpy==1.16.4. The codes are using some functions from gym==0.13.1 which are not implemented in gym==0.10.5, so please upgrade your gym before running these codes. 
### If you don't know how to upgrade gym: 
``` 
pip uninstall gym
pip install gym
```
## Python files
### These files are just using gym, and can be run by ```python filename.py``` (or ```python3 filename.py``` if you are using linux.) IDEs shold be able to run them as well.
### cheating.py is a straight solution by Mark Yu after 2 seconds of thinking, it represents Mark's superiority against AI. JK.
### simpleqlearning.py is an implementation of qlearning, an algorithm that Mark learnt from wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning). Feel free to mess with the learning rate and discountrate in the code and compare the time it takes for the AI to learn how to push the car to the summit.
